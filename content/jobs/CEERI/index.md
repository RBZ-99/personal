- Made my own unsupervised GAN model for anomaly detection, which needs data of only 1 class to train and can be used for detecting different types of anomalies and has beaten the SOTA
- Made a custom Generator with dense skip connections and an attention augmented discriminator, with selective spectral normalization with the eigen value of the weights.
- The work has been submitted for a publication at Signal, Image and Video Processing Journal.
